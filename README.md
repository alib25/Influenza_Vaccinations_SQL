# Influenza_Vaccinations_SQL

**Project Overview**

Designed a comprehensive influenza vaccine dashboard for the year 2022. The dashboard will provide insights into the distribution of flu shots among patients based on various criteria such as age, race, county, and overall statistics. Additionally, it will display a running total of vaccines administered throughout the year and a list of patients who received the vaccine.

**Data Source**

The data is syntheically generated from [Synthea](https://synthea.mitre.org). Synthea is an open-source, synthetic patient generator that models the medical history of synthetic patients.
